# Introduction
This repository contains the code for the paper [Adaptive learning via BG-thalamo-cortical circuitry]

We are currently working on making the code more concise, readable, and well-documented. The basic implementation of the LEIA model is complete, and we will be adding more code for its variants and related human experiments soon.
